## What is AWE.write?

AWE.write (Ambient Web Write) is a web based text editor. That means it runs in the browser. It has two text panes that allow side-by-side editing.

In addition, your text is saved automatically inside your browser (using Local Storage). So be carefull: If you delete your browser data, you delete your text, too.

There's not much more to it. Just you, your text and some customization settings to make it your own.

## Status

This is really, *really* old legacy code. It's basically my first JavaScript app I've ever written. But it still works.

I'm planning to re-write the app some day using more modern technologies and APIs. Maybe with native file system access. We'll see...
